ðŸ”¹ Tier 1: Must-Solve (~15â€“20 problems)
These build core intuition for sliding window â€” max/min/avg/sum/count problems in fixed or dynamic range.

âœ… Fixed-Size Window
Maximum Average Subarray I (entry-level)
Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length
Number of Subarrays of Size K and Average â‰¥ Threshold
Find All Anagrams in a String
Permutation in String
Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K
Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

âœ… Dynamic-Size Window
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Longest Repeating Character Replacement
Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Subarray Product Less Than K
Fruit Into Baskets
Max Consecutive Ones III
Grumpy Bookstore Owner
Maximum Erasure Value

âœ… Goal: Cover all key patterns: count of elements, max/min sum, character sets, product constraints, and window shrinking.

ðŸ”¹ Tier 2: Intermediate (~10â€“15 more)
These mix windowing with hashing, heaps, or other constraints.

Count Number of Nice Subarrays
Count the Number of Good Subarrays
Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones
Frequency of the Most Frequent Element
Sliding Subarray Beauty
Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff â‰¤ Limit

âœ… Goal: Handle window logic combined with frequency maps, deletion, or limits.

ðŸ”¹ Tier 3: Advanced / Rare (~5â€“10 problems)
High-difficulty, mostly for competitive/FAANG+ level.

Minimum Window Substring
Substring with Concatenation of All Words
Sliding Window Maximum
Sliding Window Median
Max Value of Equation
Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays
Subarrays with K Different Integers
Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero
