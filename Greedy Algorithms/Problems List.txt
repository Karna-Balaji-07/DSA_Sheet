High priority (commonly asked, core concepts)

Greedy & Scheduling

Array/Jump/DP crossovers
Wiggle Subsequence (subsequence greedy/dp hybrid)


Knapsack & Variants
Boats to Save People (greedy + sorting, two-pointer pattern)
Bag of Tokens (greedy energy management, lesser-known but teaches decision-making tradeoff)


Medium priority (good to strengthen intuition, less frequently asked directly)

Advantage Shuffle (relative sorting greedy, tricky but not top-tier asked)
Mice and Cheese (expected value + greedy difference)
Minimum Seconds to Equalize a Circular Array (array + greedy, more LeetCode style than interview standard)
Maximum Matching of Players with Trainers (greedy + two-pointer)
