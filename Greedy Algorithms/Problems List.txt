High priority (commonly asked, core concepts)

Greedy & Scheduling
Task Scheduler (heap + greedy, Amazon/Microsoft favorite)
Divide Intervals into Minimum Number of Groups (interval merging, sweep line)

Array/Jump/DP crossovers
Jump Game (fundamental greedy check)
Jump Game II (minimum jumps using greedy + BFS)
Wiggle Subsequence (subsequence greedy/dp hybrid)


Knapsack & Variants
Fractional Knapsack (greedy optimization, classic)
Boats to Save People (greedy + sorting, two-pointer pattern)
Bag of Tokens (greedy energy management, lesser-known but teaches decision-making tradeoff)


Medium priority (good to strengthen intuition, less frequently asked directly)
Assign Cookies (intro greedy, easy warm-up)
Cinema Seat Allocation (simulation + greedy)
Advantage Shuffle (relative sorting greedy, tricky but not top-tier asked)
Maximum Bags with Full Capacity of Rocks (resource allocation greedy)
Minimize Maximum of Array (binary search + greedy insight)
Mice and Cheese (expected value + greedy difference)
Minimum Seconds to Equalize a Circular Array (array + greedy, more LeetCode style than interview standard)
Maximum Matching of Players with Trainers (greedy + two-pointer)
